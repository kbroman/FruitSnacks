### Data on fruit snacks

My kids and I like
[Welch's fruit snacks](http://www.welchsfruitsnacks.com/). We buy them
from CostCo, in big boxes with 80 packages.

There are five flavors/colors. We're not entirely sure what the
corresponding fruits are supposed to be. The kids proposed:

- blueberry (or grape?) - _purple_
- peach - _yellow_
- raspberry - _pink_
- strawberry - _red_
- orange - _orange_

The number of fruit snacks in a package is generally 12 or 13, but
we've noticed that the five types are not equally frequent, and it
seems like they are not completely random.  For example, we prefer the
dark purple ones, and they seem to be clustered: that you often get
none or a number of them.

We wondered:

- How frequent are the five different flavors?
- Are the flavors in a package completely random?

To address these questions, we gathered some data: we counted the
number of snacks of each flavor in each package in one box. (It turned
out that there were _81_ packages rather than 80 in our box.) We took
a [photo of each](Photos/):
browse the [photo gallery](PhotoGallery.md). And, of course, I wrote down our counts on paper, which
[I scanned](Data/fruit_snacks_scanned.pdf). And I entered the data
into a [CSV file](Data/fruit_snacks.csv).

A rough analysis of the data is in
[`R/fruit_snacks.Rmd`](R/fruit_snacks.Rmd).
