### Data on fruit snacks

My kids and I like
[Welch's fruit snacks](https://www.welchsfruitsnacks.com/). We buy them
from CostCo, in big boxes with 80 packages.

There are five flavors/colors. We're not entirely sure what the
corresponding fruits are supposed to be. The kids proposed:

- blueberry (or grape?) - _purple_
- peach - _yellow_
- raspberry - _pink_
- strawberry - _red_
- orange - _orange_

The number of fruit snacks in a package is generally 12 or 13, but
we've noticed that the five types are not equally frequent, and it
seems like they are not completely random.  For example, we prefer the
dark purple ones, and they seem to be clustered: that you often get
none or a number of them.

We wondered:

- How frequent are the five different flavors?
- Are the flavors in a package completely random?

To address these questions, we gathered some data: we counted the
number of snacks of each flavor in each package in one box. (It turned
out that there were _81_ packages rather than 80 in our box.)

We presented the work at the
[Glenn Stephens](https://stephens.madison.k12.wi.us/) science fair on 2
Feb 2016. At the science fair, kids gathered data on a second box,
which contained _83_ packages rather than the expected 80.

We added data on a third box in May 2017. These data include two extra
columns: `total` and `person`. The latter takes values `d`, `c`, `a`,
or `m`.
