### Introduction

My kids and I like
[Welch's fruit snacks](http://www.welchsfruitsnacks.com/). We buy them
from CostCo, in big boxes with 80 packages.

There are five flavors/colors. We're not entirely sure what the
corresponding fruits are supposed to be. The kids proposed:

- blueberry (or grape?) - _purple_
- peach - _yellow_
- raspberry - _pink_
- strawberry - _red_
- orange - _orange_

The number of fruit snacks in a package is generally 12 or 13, but
we've noticed that the five types are not equally frequent, and it
seems like they are not completely random.  For example, we prefer the
dark purple ones, and they seem to be clustered: that you often get
none or a number of them.

We wondered:

- How frequent are the five different flavors?
- Are the flavors in a package completely random?

To address these questions, we gathered some data: we counted the
number of snacks of each flavor in each package in one box. (It turned
out that there were _81_ packages rather than 80 in our box.)

The data are available at GitHub. This document describes our results.

### Summaries

There were `r nrow(fs)` packages containing a total of `r sum(fs)`
fruit snacks in `r ncol(fs)` colors. (I'd call them "flavors" but we
can't much distinguish among them. Maybe we just eat them too quickly)
So there was an average of
`r round(sum(fs)/nrow(fs), 1)` fruit snacks per package, with a range of
`r min(n_per_package)` &ndash; `r max(n_per_package)`.  Here's the
distribution:

```{r num_snacks_per_package}
par(mar=c(4.1, 4.1, 1.1, 0.6))
hist(n_per_package, main="", xlab="Number of fruit snacks per package", las=1,
     breaks=seq(min(n_per_package)-0.25, max(n_per_package)+0.25, 0.5),
     col=barcolor)
```

The different colors have quite different frequencies. Here's a plot
of the average number of snacks of each color in a package, with 95%
confidence intervals.

```{r ave_of_each_color, fig.width=6}
par(mar=c(4.1, 4.1, 1.1, 0.6))
ave_per_type <- colMeans(fs)
color <- "slateblue"
ymx <- max(ave_per_type)*1.1
yli <- c(0, ymx*1.05)
x <- seq(along=ave_per_type)
grayplot(x, ave_per_type, type="n",
         xlab="Color", ylab="Ave. pieces per package",
         ylim=yli, hlines=pretty(yli), yaxs="i",
         xlim=range(x)+c(-0.5, 0.5), xaxs="i", xat=NA,
         vlines=x, vlines.lwd=3, vlines.col="gray70",
         bgcolor="gray85")
axis(side=1, at=x, colnames(fs), tick=FALSE, mgp=c(0, 0.2, 0))
xwidth <- 0.2
segments(x-xwidth, ave_per_type, x+xwidth, ave_per_type,
         col=color, lwd=2)
ci <- apply(fs, 2, function(a) t.test(a)$conf.int)
segments(x, ci[1,], x, ci[2,], lwd=2, col=color)
for(i in 1:nrow(ci))
    segments(x-xwidth/2, ci[i,], x+xwidth/2, ci[i,], lwd=2, col=color)
```

Here are histograms of the number of snacks per package for each color.

```{r hist_of_each_color, fig.height=12}
par(mfrow=c(5,1), mar=c(4.1, 4.1, 2.1, 0.6))
br <- seq(-0.25, max(fs)+0.25, by=0.5)
for(i in 1:ncol(fs)) {
  hist(fs[,i], breaks=br, xlab="Number per package",
       las=1, col=barcolor, main="")
  u <- par("usr")
  text(7, sum(u[3:4]*c(0.4,0.6)), colnames(fs)[i], cex=2, adj=0.5)
}
```

We can see immediately that there is variation in the frequency of the
different colors.

### Is there clustering of colors?

But the distributions look plausibly random. If
colors were randomly assigned to packages (but at color-specific
frequencies), these would be mixtures of binomial
distributions. (_Mixtures_, because the number of snacks in a package
varies.)

I'll first focus on the purple ones.
