### Introduction

My kids and I like
[Welch's fruit snacks](http://www.welchsfruitsnacks.com/). We buy them
from CostCo, in big boxes with 80 packages.

There are five flavors/colors. We're not entirely sure what the
corresponding fruits are supposed to be. The kids proposed:

- blueberry (or grape?) - _purple_
- peach - _yellow_
- raspberry - _pink_
- strawberry - _red_
- orange - _orange_

The number of fruit snacks in a package is generally 12 or 13, but
we've noticed that the five types are not equally frequent, and it
seems like they are not completely random.  For example, we prefer the
dark purple ones, and they seem to be clustered: that you often get
none or a number of them.

We wondered:

- How frequent are the five different flavors?
- Are the flavors in a package completely random?

To address these questions, we gathered some data: we counted the
number of snacks of each flavor in each package in one box. (It turned
out that there were _81_ packages rather than 80 in our box.)

The data are available at GitHub. This document describes our results.

### Summaries

There were `r nrow(fs)` packages containing a total of `r sum(fs)`
fruit snacks in `r ncol(fs)` colors. (I'd call them "flavors" but we
can't much distinguish among them. Maybe we just eat them too quickly)
So there was an average of
`r round(sum(fs)/nrow(fs), 1)` fruit snacks per package, with a range of
`r min(n_per_package)` &ndash; `r max(n_per_package)`.  Here's the
distribution:

```{r num_snacks_per_package}
par(mar=c(4.1, 4.1, 1.1, 0.6))
hist(n_per_package, main="", xlab="Number of fruit snacks per package", las=1,
     breaks=seq(min(n_per_package)-0.25, max(n_per_package)+0.25, 0.5),
     col=barcolor)
```

The different colors have quite different frequencies. Here's a plot
of the average number of snacks of each color in a package, with 95%
confidence intervals.

```{r ave_of_each_color, fig.width=6}
par(mar=c(4.1, 4.1, 1.1, 0.6))
ave_per_type <- colMeans(fs)
color <- "slateblue"
ymx <- max(ave_per_type)*1.1
yli <- c(0, ymx*1.05)
x <- seq(along=ave_per_type)
grayplot(x, ave_per_type, type="n",
         xlab="Color", ylab="Ave. pieces per package",
         ylim=yli, hlines=pretty(yli), yaxs="i",
         xlim=range(x)+c(-0.5, 0.5), xaxs="i", xat=NA,
         vlines=x, vlines.lwd=3, vlines.col="gray70",
         bgcolor="gray85")
axis(side=1, at=x, colnames(fs), tick=FALSE, mgp=c(0, 0.2, 0))
xwidth <- 0.2
segments(x-xwidth, ave_per_type, x+xwidth, ave_per_type,
         col=color, lwd=2)
ci <- apply(fs, 2, function(a) t.test(a)$conf.int)
segments(x, ci[1,], x, ci[2,], lwd=2, col=color)
for(i in 1:nrow(ci))
    segments(x-xwidth/2, ci[i,], x+xwidth/2, ci[i,], lwd=2, col=color)
```

Here are histograms of the number of snacks per package for each color.

```{r hist_of_each_color, fig.height=12}
par(mfrow=c(5,1), mar=c(4.1, 4.1, 2.1, 0.6))
br <- seq(-0.25, max(fs)+0.25, by=0.5)
for(i in 1:ncol(fs)) {
  hist(fs[,i], breaks=br, xlab="Number per package",
       las=1, col=barcolor, main="")
  u <- par("usr")
  text(7, sum(u[3:4]*c(0.4,0.6)), colnames(fs)[i], cex=2, adj=0.5)
}
```

### Tests for differences

It seems pretty clear from the histograms above that pink and red are
the most common. In the observed data, orange is least common. Can we
infer a general rule here? In Welch's big vat of fruit snacks, are
pink and red most common, purple and yellow in the middle, and orange
least common?

We'll do some simple pairwise statistical tests, to check this. For
example, if purple and pink are equally frequent in Welch's vat of
fruit snacks, what would be the chance of seeing data as different as
observed? I'll use pairwise, paired permutation tests.

The following are the p-values obtained from 10,000 permutations for
each pair of colors.

```{r permtests, cache=TRUE, results="markup"}
pval <- rep(1, choose(ncol(fs), 2))
k <- 1
for(i in 1:(ncol(fs)-1)) {
    for(j in (i+1):ncol(fs)) {
        pval[k] <- broman::paired.perm.test(fs[,i] - fs[,j], n.perm=10000)
        names(pval)[k] <- paste(colnames(fs)[i], colnames(fs)[j], sep=":")
        k <- k+1
    }
}
pval <- as.matrix(pval)
colnames(pval) <- "p-value"
print(pval, digits=2)
```

As seen in this table of p-values, there's very strong evidence that orange,purple,yellow <
pink,red, and reasonably strong evidence that orange < purple,yellow.
The observed differences in the frequency of the purple and
yellow snacks can reasonably be ascribed to chance variation, as are
the differences between pink and red.



### Is there clustering of colors?

But the distributions look plausibly random. If
colors were randomly assigned to packages (but at color-specific
frequencies), these would be mixtures of binomial
distributions. (_Mixtures_, because the number of snacks in a package
varies.)

I'll first focus on the purple ones.
