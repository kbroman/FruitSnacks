### Introduction

My kids and I like
[Welch's fruit snacks](http://www.welchsfruitsnacks.com/). We buy them
from CostCo, in big boxes with 80 packages.

There are five flavors/colors. We're not entirely sure what the
corresponding fruits are supposed to be. The kids proposed:

- blueberry (or grape?) - _purple_
- peach - _yellow_
- raspberry - _pink_
- strawberry - _red_
- orange - _orange_

The number of fruit snacks in a package is generally 12 or 13, but
we've noticed that the five types are not equally frequent, and it
seems like they are not completely random.  For example, we prefer the
dark purple ones, and they seem to be clustered: that you often get
none or a number of them.

We wondered:

- How frequent are the five different flavors?
- Are the flavors in a package completely random?

To address these questions, we gathered some data: we counted the
number of snacks of each flavor in each package in one box. (It turned
out that there were _81_ packages rather than 80 in our box.)

The data are available at GitHub. This document describes our results.

I don't give many methods details here; they're described in
[a separate document](http://kbroman.org/FruitSnacks/assets/fruit_snacks_methods.html).


### Summaries

There were `r nrow(fs)` packages containing a total of `r sum(fs)`
fruit snacks in `r ncol(fs)` colors. (I'd call them "flavors" but we
can't much distinguish among them. Maybe we just eat them too quickly)
So there was an average of
`r round(sum(fs)/nrow(fs), 1)` fruit snacks per package, with a range of
`r min(n_per_package)` &ndash; `r max(n_per_package)`.  Here's the
distribution:

```{r num_snacks_per_package}
par(mar=c(4.1, 4.1, 1.1, 0.6))
hist(n_per_package, main="", xlab="Number of fruit snacks per package", las=1,
     breaks=seq(min(n_per_package)-0.25, max(n_per_package)+0.25, 0.5),
     col=barcolor)
```

The different colors have quite different frequencies. Here's a plot
of the average number of snacks of each color in a package, with 95%
confidence intervals.

```{r ave_of_each_color, fig.width=6}
par(mar=c(4.1, 4.1, 1.1, 0.6))
ave_per_type <- colMeans(fs)
color <- "slateblue"
ymx <- max(ave_per_type)*1.1
yli <- c(0, ymx*1.05)
x <- seq(along=ave_per_type)
broman::grayplot(x, ave_per_type, type="n",
         xlab="Color", ylab="Ave. pieces per package",
         ylim=yli, hlines=pretty(yli), yaxs="i",
         xlim=range(x)+c(-0.5, 0.5), xaxs="i", xat=NA,
         vlines=x, vlines.lwd=3, vlines.col="gray70",
         bgcolor="gray85")
axis(side=1, at=x, colnames(fs), tick=FALSE, mgp=c(0, 0.2, 0))
xwidth <- 0.2
segments(x-xwidth, ave_per_type, x+xwidth, ave_per_type,
         col=color, lwd=2)
ci <- apply(fs, 2, function(a) t.test(a)$conf.int)
segments(x, ci[1,], x, ci[2,], lwd=2, col=color)
for(i in 1:nrow(ci))
    segments(x-xwidth/2, ci[i,], x+xwidth/2, ci[i,], lwd=2, col=color)
```

Here are histograms of the number of snacks per package for each color.

```{r hist_of_each_color, fig.height=12}
par(mfrow=c(5,1), mar=c(4.1, 4.1, 2.1, 0.6))
br <- seq(-0.25, max(fs)+0.25, by=0.5)
for(i in 1:ncol(fs)) {
  hist(fs[,i], breaks=br, xlab="Number per package",
       las=1, col=barcolor, main="")
  u <- par("usr")
  text(7, sum(u[3:4]*c(0.4,0.6)), colnames(fs)[i], cex=2, adj=0.5)
}
```

## Tests for differences

It seems pretty clear from the histograms above that pink and red are
the most common. In the observed data, orange is least common. Can we
infer a general rule here? In Welch's big vat of fruit snacks, are
pink and red most common, purple and yellow in the middle, and orange
least common?

We'll do some simple pairwise statistical tests, to check this. For
example, if purple and pink are equally frequent in Welch's vat of
fruit snacks, what would be the chance of seeing data as different as
observed? I'll use pairwise, paired permutation tests.

The following are the p-values obtained from 10,000 permutations for
each pair of colors.

```{r permtests, cache=TRUE, results="markup"}
pval <- rep(1, choose(ncol(fs), 2))
k <- 1
for(i in 1:(ncol(fs)-1)) {
    for(j in (i+1):ncol(fs)) {
        pval[k] <- broman::paired.perm.test(fs[,i] - fs[,j], n.perm=10000)
        names(pval)[k] <- paste(colnames(fs)[i], colnames(fs)[j], sep=":")
        k <- k+1
    }
}
pval <- as.matrix(pval)
colnames(pval) <- "p-value"
print(pval, digits=2)
```

As seen in this table of p-values, there's very strong evidence that orange,purple,yellow <
pink,red, and reasonably strong evidence that orange < purple,yellow.
The observed differences in the frequency of the purple and
yellow snacks can reasonably be ascribed to chance variation, as are
the differences between pink and red.



### Is there clustering of colors?

I've had the impression that there is some clustering of colors. For
example, there seemed to be a tendency to get either no purple snacks
or many purple snacks.

If colors were randomly assigned to packages (but at color-specific
frequencies), the number of snacks of a particular color, given the
total number of snacks in a package, would follow
a binomial distribution. The distribution of the counts of
a particular color across packages would follow a mixture of binomial
distributions. (A _mixture_, because the number of snacks in a package
varies.)

It might be best to stratify based on the number of snacks in a
package, but I'm going to just look overall. The simplest thing to do
is to look at the varibility (as measured by the standard deviation
SD) in the number of snacks of a particular color. If purple snacks
are clustered, the SD should be higher than that expected under the
binomial mixture model.

I'll compare the observed SDs of the counts of each color across
packages to what would be expected if colors were assigned to packages
completely at random, and I'll calculate a p-value from a
randomization test: compare the observed SD to the distributed of
estimated SDs you get when you randomly permute the snacks across
packages.

```{r calc_obs_and_expected_sd}
source("func.R")
obs_sd <- apply(fs, 2, sd)
exp_sd <- apply(fs, 2, function(a, b) calc_sd_binommixture(rowSums(b), sum(a)/sum(b)), fs)
```

```{r setup_table_for_perm_test}
# make a "tidy" table; shuffle one color relative to other to do randomization test
tidytab <- data.frame(package=rep(0, sum(fs)), color=rep(0, sum(fs)))
tidytab$package <- unlist(apply(fs, 2, function(a) rep(1:nrow(fs), a)))
cur <- 0
for(i in 1:ncol(fs)) {
    tidytab$color[cur + 1:sum(fs[,i])] <- rep(i, sum(fs[,i]))
    cur <- cur + sum(fs[,i])
}
stopifnot( all(table(tidytab$package, tidytab$color) == fs) )
```

```{r perm_test_sd, cache=TRUE}
n.perm <- 10000
permsd <- matrix(ncol=ncol(fs), nrow=n.perm)
for(i in 1:n.perm) {
    permdat <- table(tidytab$package, sample(tidytab$color))
    permsd[i,] <- apply(permdat, 2, sd)
}
```

```{r calc_pvals_clustering}
pval <- rep(0, ncol(fs))
names(pval) <- colnames(fs)
for(i in seq(along=pval)) {
    pval[i] <- mean(abs(permsd[,i] - exp_sd[i]) >= abs(obs_sd[i] - exp_sd[i]))
}
```

I'll performed two-sided tests, with 10,000 permutations.

Here are the results: observed and expected SDs, and a p-value for the
test.

```{r show_results, results="markup"}
results <- cbind(observed_SD=obs_sd, expected_SD=exp_sd, "p-value"=round(pval, 3))
print(results, digits=3)
```

The purple snacks are have higher-than-expected SD (indicating
possible clustering), but the yellow snacks have lower-than-expected
SD (indicating anti-clustering: that the snacks are more evenly
distributed than would be expected under randomness). But in both
cases, the observed difference could reasonably be ascribed to chance
variation.

I was using counts there; it seems like maybe I should look at the
_proportion_ instead: for each color, the SD across packages of the
proportion of snacks that are that color.


```{r calc_obs_and_expected_sd_prop}
obs_sd_prop <- apply(fs/rowSums(fs), 2, sd)
exp_sd_prop <- apply(fs, 2, function(a, b) calc_sdprop_binommixture(rowSums(b), sum(a)/sum(b)), fs)
```

```{r perm_test_sd_prop, cache=TRUE}
n.perm <- 10000
permsdprop <- matrix(ncol=ncol(fs), nrow=n.perm)
for(i in 1:n.perm) {
    permdat <- table(tidytab$package, sample(tidytab$color))
    permsdprop[i,] <- apply(permdat/rowSums(permdat), 2, sd)
}
```

```{r calc_pvals_clustering_prop}
pval_prop <- rep(0, ncol(fs))
names(pval_prop) <- colnames(fs)
for(i in seq(along=pval_prop))
    pval_prop[i] <- mean(abs(permsdprop[,i] - exp_sd_prop[i]) >= abs(obs_sd_prop[i] - exp_sd_prop[i]))
```

So I'll repeat the permutation tests, using the SD of the proportions
as my test statistic, and again using 10,000 permutation replicates.

Here are the results: observed and expected SDs of the proportions, and a p-value for the
test.

```{r show_results_prop, results="markup"}
results <- cbind(observed_SD_prop=obs_sd_prop, expected_SD_prop=exp_sd_prop, "p-value"=pval_prop)
print(round(results, 3), digits=3)
```

Using the SD of the proportions as the test statistic, the evidence
for clustering in the purple snacks is a bit stronger, with
P=`r round(pval_prop[1], 3)`. I'll tentatively conclude that there _is_
clustering. But maybe we should gather some more data.
