### Introduction

In
[the document](http://kbroman.org/FruitSnacks/assets/fruit_snacks.html)
describing my analysis of the
[fruit snacks data](https://github.com/kbroman/FruitSnacks), I focused
on high-level results and suppressed discussion of the details of my
analyses. In the present document, I'll describe some of the tricks I used.

We can load the data directly from the web with `read.csv()`.

```{r load_data}
fs <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kbroman/FruitSnacks/master/Data/fruit_snacks.csv")
```

I'll drop the first column, which just contains identifiers
(1&ndash;`r nrow(fs)`) for the fruit snack packages.

```{r drop_first_column}
fs <- fs[,-1]
```

### Paired permutation tests

To evaluate differences in the frequencies of different colors of
snacks, I consider a pair of colors and then used a paired permutation
test (with the t-statistic). This was accomplished with the
`paired.perm.test()` function in the
[R/broman](https://github.com/kbroman/broman) package. That function
can do an _exhaustive_ permutation test (for small samples), or a
simulation-based permutation test, as used here.

Here's a simplified version of the function, just for the
simulation-based permutation test:

```{r paired_perm_test, eval=FALSE}
paired.perm.test <-
function(d, n.perm=10000)
{
    n <- length(d)
    tobs <- t.test(d)$statistic

    allt <- 1:n.perm
    for(i in 1:n.perm) {
        permd <- d*sample(c(-1,1), n, replace=TRUE)
        allt[i] <- t.test(permd)$statistic
    }

    mean(abs(allt) >= abs(tobs))
}
```

The input is a set of differences, `d`. I calculate the t-statistic
with the R function `t.test()`, and the central permutation test part
involves a `for` loop. I use `sample()` to apply a random sign
(positive or negative) to each difference, and then `t.test()` again
to calculate the t-statistic. The returned p-value is the proportion
of t-statistics from the permutations that are &ge; the observed one,
in absolute value.

### Calculation of SDs for each color

The data are contained in a matrix `fs`, with `r nrow(fs)` rows (the
observed packages) and `r ncol(fs)` columns (the different colors).
To calculate the observed SD for the number of snacks of each color, I
use `apply`, as follows:

```{r calc_obs_sd}
obs_sd <- apply(fs, 2, sd)
```

To calculate the SD of the _proportions_, I first calculate the number
of snacks per package, using `rowSums`. I then convert the counts to
proportions by dividing by those sums. (This makes use the fact that
the data are stored by column, and the column of row sums will be
repeated. I then use `apply` again.

```{r calc_prop}
n_per_package <- rowSums(fs)
props <- fs / n_per_package
obs_sd_prop <- apply(props, 2, sd)
```


### Expected SD under binomial mixture model

In the analysis of clustering, the _null_ model is that the colors
were randomly assigned to packages (but at color-specific
frequencies). Thus the number of snacks of a particular color, given
the total number of snacks in a package, follows a binomial
distribution. The distribution of the counts of a particular color
across packages then follows a mixture of binomial distributions.

I wrote a function to calculate the SD for such a binomial mixture.
This is maybe a bit messy.

```{r calc_sd_binommixture}
calc_sd_binommixture <-
    function(n=rowSums(fs), p=sum(fs[,1])/sum(fs))
{
    maxn <- max(n)
    tabn <- table(n)
    prop_n <- tabn/length(n)
    n <- as.numeric(names(tabn))
    probs <- t(vapply(n, function(number) dbinom(0:maxn, number, prob=p), rep(0, maxn+1)))

    probs <- colSums(probs * rep(prop_n, ncol(probs)))

    xmean <- sum(probs*(0:maxn))

    sqrt(sum(probs * ((0:maxn) - xmean)^2))
}
```

The input is a vector of numbers of snacks per package (`n`) and the
frequency of a particular color (`p`). I determine the unique values
in `n`, and then use `dbinom()` and `vapply()` to get the binomial
probabilities. I then use `colSums()` to get the probabilities
for the binomial mixture. Finally, I calculate the mean and then the
SD of that mixture distribution.

To actually calculate the set of expected SDs, I use `apply()`.

```{r calc_exp_sd}
exp_sd <- apply(fs, 2, function(a, b) calc_sd_binommixture(rowSums(b), sum(a)/sum(b)), fs)
```

There's a similar function for calculation the SD of the proportions,
for this sort of binomial mixture. The only difference is that I need
to use values that are proportions rather than numbers. I probably
should have merged these two functions into one, to not have all of
the repeated code.

```{r calc_sdprop_binommixture}
calc_sdprop_binommixture <-
    function(n=rowSums(fs), p=sum(fs[,1])/sum(fs))
{
    maxn <- max(n)
    tabn <- table(n)
    prop_n <- tabn/length(n)
    n <- as.numeric(names(tabn))
    probs <- t(vapply(n, function(number) dbinom(0:maxn, number, prob=p), rep(0, maxn+1)))

    probs <- probs * rep(prop_n, ncol(probs))
    vals <- t(vapply(n, function(number) (0:maxn)/number, rep(0, maxn+1)))

    xmean <- sum(probs*vals)

    sqrt(sum(probs * (vals - xmean)^2))
}
```



### Permuting the main data set

To evaluate clustering, I could have compared the observed SD for a
color to the distribution obtained by simulating data under the
binomial mixture. I choose instead to do a permutation test: take the
`r sum(fs)` snacks and randomly assign them to packages, keeping the
number of snacks of each color constrained. I don't think it matters
so much; I think the permutation test is a bit more cute.

To perform the permutation test, I first create a
"[tidy table](http://www.jstatsoft.org/v59/i10/paper)", with each row
being a particular snack and with two columns: a numeric index
(1&ndash;`r nrow(fs)`) for the package it was in, and a numeric index
(1&ndash;`r ncol(fs)`) for its color.

I create this table using a bit of `apply()`, `rep()`, and a `for` loop.

```{r create_tidy_table}
tidytab <- data.frame(package=rep(0, sum(fs)), color=rep(0, sum(fs)))
tidytab$package <- unlist(apply(fs, 2, function(a) rep(1:nrow(fs), a)))
cur <- 0
for(i in 1:ncol(fs)) {
    tidytab$color[cur + 1:sum(fs[,i])] <- rep(i, sum(fs[,i]))
    cur <- cur + sum(fs[,i])
}
```

The first part of the table looks like this:

```{r head_tidy_table}
head(tidytab)
```

To get this back to the table of packages &times; colors, use
`table()`. It's good to check that you get the same result.

```{r reconstruct_table}
tab <- table(tidytab$package, tidytab$color)
all(tab == fs)
```

In the permutation test, I just need to shuffle one column relative to
the other (using `sample`) and then use `table()` to get the counts.

```{r one_permutation}
permtab <- table(tidytab$package, sample(tidytab$color))
```


### Permutation test with SD as statistic

With the code from the previous section, the permutation test is then
pretty simple: I use a `for` loop to repeated permute the data, in
each case using `apply` to calculate the column SDs.

```{r do_permutations, cache=TRUE}
n.perm <- 10000
permsd <- matrix(ncol=ncol(fs), nrow=n.perm)
for(i in 1:n.perm) {
    permdat <- table(tidytab$package, sample(tidytab$color))
    permsd[i,] <- apply(permdat, 2, sd)
}
```

To calculate p-values, I look at the proportion of permutation
replicates that gave an SD that was farther away from the expected SD,
in absolute value, than what was actually observed.

```{r calc_pvals}

pval <- rep(0, ncol(fs))
names(pval) <- colnames(fs)
for(i in seq(along=pval))
    pval[i] <- mean(abs(permsd[,i] - exp_sd[i]) >= abs(obs_sd[i] - exp_sd[i]))
```

The permutation test using the SD of the proportions rather than the
SD of the counts is basically the same, I just need to convert to
proportions before calculating the SDs.

```{r perm_test_sd_prop, cache=TRUE}
n.perm <- 10000
permsdprop <- matrix(ncol=ncol(fs), nrow=n.perm)
for(i in 1:n.perm) {
    permdat <- table(tidytab$package, sample(tidytab$color))
    permsdprop[i,] <- apply(permdat/rowSums(permdat), 2, sd)
}
```
